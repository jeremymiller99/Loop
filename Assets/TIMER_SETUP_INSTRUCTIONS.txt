COUNTDOWN TIMER SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
===================================

Your countdown timer system has been implemented! Here's how to set it up:

AUTOMATIC SETUP (Recommended):
1. Open your scene in Unity
2. Create an empty GameObject and name it "Timer UI Manager"
3. Add the TimerUI script to this GameObject
4. In the Inspector, right-click on the TimerUI script header
5. Select "Create Timer UI Canvas" from the context menu
6. This will automatically create a Canvas with Timer and Phase text

MANUAL SETUP:
1. Create a Canvas in your scene (UI > Canvas)
2. Create two Text objects as children of the Canvas:
   - "Timer Text" for countdown display  
   - "Phase Text" for current phase info (optional)
3. Position them at the top of the screen
4. In your PlayerManager component:
   - Drag the Timer Text into the "Timer Text" field
5. Configure timer settings in PlayerManager:
   - Phase Timer Duration: 30 seconds (default)
   - Enable Timer: checked

CONFIGURATION OPTIONS:
- phaseTimerDuration: How long each phase lasts (default: 30 seconds)
- enableTimer: Toggle to turn timer on/off for testing
- timerText: Reference to UI Text component for countdown display

FEATURES:
✓ Countdown timer for each phase (Player 1 and Player 2 phases)
✓ Timer resets when phases restart
✓ Both players "die" if time runs out
✓ Timer display turns red in last 10 seconds
✓ Shows "TIME'S UP!" message when expired
✓ Automatic level restart after timeout
✓ Timer stops when phase completes successfully

HOW IT WORKS:
- Phase 1: Player 1 has X seconds to reach the goal
- Phase 2: Player 2 has X seconds to shoot Player 1  
- If time runs out in either phase, both players fail and level restarts
- Timer pauses when phases complete and resets for new phases

TESTING:
- Press 'R' to restart the level manually
- Timer duration can be adjusted in PlayerManager inspector
- Disable timer completely by unchecking "Enable Timer"

The system integrates seamlessly with your existing game flow!
