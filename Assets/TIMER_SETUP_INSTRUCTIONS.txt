ENHANCED UI SYSTEM SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
=====================================

Your enhanced UI system with timer, loop tracking, and game flow feedback has been implemented! Here's how to set it up:

AUTOMATIC SETUP (Recommended):
1. Open your scene in Unity
2. Create an empty GameObject and name it "Timer UI Manager"
3. Add the TimerUI script to this GameObject
4. In the Inspector, right-click on the TimerUI script header
5. Select "Create Timer UI Canvas" from the context menu
6. This will automatically create a complete UI system with:
   - Timer display (top center)
   - Phase information text
   - Loop counter ("X/Y Loops")
   - Animated "Loop Complete!" popup (center screen)
   - Level completion panel with run statistics

MANUAL SETUP:
1. Create a Canvas in your scene (UI > Canvas)
2. Create the following UI elements as children of the Canvas:
   - "Timer Text" for countdown display (top center)
   - "Phase Text" for current phase info (below timer)
   - "Loop Counter Text" for loop progress (below phase text)
   - "Loop Complete Popup" for animated feedback (center screen, initially hidden)
   - "Level Complete Panel" with background and details text (full screen overlay, initially hidden)
   - "Close Button" inside the level complete panel
3. Position them appropriately on screen
4. In the TimerUI component:
   - Drag all UI elements into their respective fields
5. Configure timer settings in PlayerManager:
   - Phase Timer Duration: 30 seconds (default)
   - Enable Timer: checked

CONFIGURATION OPTIONS:
- phaseTimerDuration: How long each phase lasts (default: 30 seconds)
- enableTimer: Toggle to turn timer on/off for testing
- timerText: Reference to UI Text component for countdown display

FEATURES:
✓ Countdown timer for each phase (Player 1 and Player 2 phases)
✓ Timer resets when phases restart
✓ Both players "die" if time runs out
✓ Timer display turns red in last 10 seconds
✓ Shows "TIME'S UP!" message when expired
✓ Automatic level restart after timeout
✓ Timer stops when phase completes successfully
✓ Loop counter showing progress ("X/Y Loops")
✓ Animated "Loop Complete!" popup with bounce effect
✓ Level completion panel with detailed run statistics:
  - Total play time
  - Loops completed
  - Average time per loop
✓ Dismissible completion panel with close button
✓ Total play time tracking across all loops
✓ Event-driven UI updates for responsive feedback

HOW IT WORKS:
- Phase 1: Player 1 has X seconds to reach the goal
- Phase 2: Player 2 has X seconds to shoot Player 1  
- If time runs out in either phase, both players fail and level restarts
- Timer pauses when phases complete and resets for new phases
- When a loop completes successfully:
  1. Animated "LOOP COMPLETE!" popup appears in center
  2. Loop counter updates (e.g., "1/1 Loops")
  3. If more loops needed, next loop starts automatically
  4. If all loops done, level completion panel shows with stats
- Level completion panel displays:
  - Total time spent
  - Number of loops completed
  - Average time per loop
- Player can close the completion panel and continue playing

TESTING:
- Press 'R' to restart the level manually
- Timer duration can be adjusted in PlayerManager inspector
- Disable timer completely by unchecking "Enable Timer"

The system integrates seamlessly with your existing game flow!
